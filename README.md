Hello!

I decided to share my first setup for Nvim

It is perfect for a Frontend developer
For example, my stack:
- React
- TypeScript
- StyledComponents
- Effector

Some useful links:
- <a href="https://github.com/exosyphon/nvim">it is also configured with a different architecture</a>
- <a href="https://neovimcraft.com">portal with different plugins</a> 
- <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vim">Lots of discussion on Reddit</a>
